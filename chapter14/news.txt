CPUs provide hardware support for strong isolation. For example, RISC-V has three modes in which the CPU can execute instructions: machine mode, supervisor mode, and user mode. Instructions executing in machine mode have full privilege; a CPU starts in machine mode. Machine mode is mostly intended for configuring a computer. Xv6 executes a few lines in machine mode and then changes to supervisor mode.
